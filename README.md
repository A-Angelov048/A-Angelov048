## Glad to see you here!

I'm Alex from Bulgaria, and I'm currently studying the full path of JavaScript at ðŸŽ“ Software University. I really like learning JS, and I have an interest in learning other languages like Python, C#, TypeScript, and various frameworks. I also possess skills such as attention to details, teamwork, organization, effective communication, precision, and quick adaptation to new software. My goal is to become a software engineer in the near future, working as a Full Stack Dev, Front-end Dev, or in some aspect of Frontend Development.

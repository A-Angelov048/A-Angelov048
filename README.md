## Glad to see you here!

I'm Alex from Bulgaria, and I'm currently studying the full JavaScript path at ðŸŽ“ Software University. I really enjoy learning JavaScript and am also interested in exploring other languages like Python, C#, and TypeScript, as well as various frameworks. I bring skills such as attention to detail, teamwork, organization, effective communication, precision, and the ability to quickly adapt to new software. My goal is to become a software engineer in the near future, either as a Full Stack Developer, Front-end Developer, or in a role related to Frontend Development.
